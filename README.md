## Project Progress

### Stand Up 1: Project Initiation and Planning

During the first standup, we established the project foundation and outlined our vision for the road safety data visualization platform.

**Ideas and Concepts:**
- Identified the need for visualizing Australian road safety enforcement data
- Planned to use BITRE datasets covering fines, breath tests, and drug tests
- Designed a multi-page structure with dedicated analytics pages
- Conceptualized an interactive Australian map as the homepage centerpiece
- Decided on D3.js for creating dynamic, interactive visualizations

**Implementation in Website:**
- Created the homepage (`index.html`) with an interactive map of Australia
- Implemented dataset switching functionality for different data types (Positive Breath Tests, Positive Drug Tests, Alcohol & Drug Tests)
- Set up the project structure with separate pages for each analytics category
- Established the navigation system with dropdown menus for easy access to analytics pages

---

### Stand Up 2: Core Features Development

In the second standup, we focused on building the core analytical features and visualization components.

**Ideas and Concepts:**
- Developed the three-chart system: bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, and pie charts for distributions
- Implemented KPI metrics to provide quick insights (Total, Highest State, Lowest State)
- Created filtering and comparison capabilities for deeper data exploration
- Designed a unified analytics framework that could be reused across different data pages

**Implementation in Website:**
- Built the analytics pages (`fines.html`, `positive_breath_tests.html`, `positive_drug_tests.html`, `alcohol_drug_tests.html`)
- Created `analytics-common.js` as a shared library for chart rendering and data processing
- Implemented individual page scripts (`fines.page.js`, etc.) for data-specific configurations
- Added interactive controls for year range selection, metric comparison, and jurisdiction filtering
- Developed the KPI dashboard component that updates dynamically based on selected data
- Created data tables for detailed numerical views alongside visualizations

---

### Stand Up 3: Refinement and Enhancement

The third standup focused on polishing the user experience, adding advanced features, and ensuring data accuracy.

**Ideas and Concepts:**
- Enhanced interactivity with hover tooltips and smooth transitions
- Implemented responsive design principles for better accessibility
- Added reset and filter management controls for improved usability
- Created the About page to showcase the team and project mission
- Improved data processing to handle multiple datasets and column detection automatically

**Implementation in Website:**
- Enhanced the homepage map with automatic column detection for flexible data loading
- Added smooth transitions and animations to charts using D3.js transitions
- Implemented the About page (`about.html`) with team member profiles and project information
- Added reset buttons and improved filter controls across all analytics pages
- Created a consistent design system with reusable CSS components
- Improved tooltip functionality with better formatting and accessibility
- Enhanced the map with year filtering and automatic latest year selection

---

## How Ideas Were Used in the Website

### Interactive Map Concept
The homepage features an interactive Australian map that allows users to:
- Switch between different datasets using button controls
- Hover over states to see detailed information in tooltips
- View color-coded visualizations based on data values
- Clear the map with a "No Data" option

### Multi-Chart Analytics System
Each analytics page implements a consistent three-chart approach:
1. **Bar Charts**: Enable state-by-state comparison with filtering capabilities
2. **Line Charts**: Show trends over time with customizable year ranges
3. **Pie Charts**: Display proportional distribution with configurable top N slices

### Data Exploration Features
- **Year Range Filtering**: Users can select specific time periods to analyze trends
- **Jurisdiction Selection**: Multi-select filters allow comparing specific states/territories
- **Metric Comparison**: Compare multiple metrics side-by-side in bar charts
- **KPI Dashboard**: Quick insights at the top of each analytics page

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly navigation with dropdown menus
- Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Accessible color schemes and interactive elements
